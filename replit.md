## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Command**: `npm run dev`
- **Process**: tsx runs TypeScript server directly with hot reload
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Database**: Development mode uses in-memory storage

### Production Build
- **Frontend Build**: `vite build` compiles React app to static assets
- **Backend Build**: `esbuild` bundles server code for Node.js execution
- **Output**: Static files in `dist/public`, server bundle in `dist/index.js`
- **Execution**: `node dist/index.js` runs production server

### Environment Configuration
- **Database URL**: Required environment variable for PostgreSQL connection
- **Email Services**: RESEND_API_KEY for contact form email delivery
- **GitHub Integration**: GITHUB_PUBLIC_TOKEN for community activity feed
- **Replit Integration**: Special handling for Replit environment with cartographer plugin
- **Static Serving**: Express serves built frontend assets in production

### Database Migration
- **Schema**: Defined in `shared/schema.ts` with users table
- **Migrations**: `npm run db:push` applies schema changes
- **Current State**: Basic user schema exists but application uses memory storage
- **Future**: Ready for PostgreSQL integration when user authentication is needed
